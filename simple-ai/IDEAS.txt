unsupervised learning:
	1) babies can tell something is moving, assume they don't have much supervised learning
	2) compare 2 consecutive frames and find simliar and difference.
	
iterative method:
	1) baby was born with blurred vision
	2) blurred vison can only tell contour
	3) contour matching using eigen vectors?
	4) pass contour to neural network
	5) pass neural network result back to contour
	
	1) supervised deep homography model
	2) unsupervised deep homography model
	
knowledge database:
	1) let's do some pattern learning on primitive shape.


Reference:
	1) some cool existing tech:
		* superpixel: modified kmean
		* graph-cut: need prior info
		* active-contour: optimization tech, seems too slow
		* region descriptor: region features
