suffixes x[i: ->]
prefixes x[<- :i]
substrings x[i:j]



Problem: Parenthesization:
Given a sequence of matrix multiplication: A0 * A1 * A2 * ... An-1
Find parenthesization to reduce the number of operations:

Solution:
1) guessing outermost/last multiplication
	(A0...Ak-1)*(Ak-1...An-1) has least number of multiplication
	then we can subdivide the problem.
	
2) subproblem = optimal solution of Ai ... Aj-1
	once the range is less than 2, we can know the output.

3) recurrence:
	DP(i, j) = min(
		for k in range(i, j):
			DP(i, k) + DP(k, j) + cost(Ai:k * Ak:j)
	)
