What's my background:
	1) gameplay programmer from ND. 
	My main focus is player mechanics, animation, weapon gameplay, etc.

	
My question for Zoox:
	1) what're sim team projects:
		1) recreate real world senario in simulation tool?
		does self-driving AI learn from simulation and correct its behavior?
		or it's a tool of evaluation its performance?
		2) do you write your simulator from scratch?
		
	2) what's the relationship between sim team and other team?
	3) what's your job at zoox?	
	4) what's one day at zoox?
	5) how does your simulator look like?
