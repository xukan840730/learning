Computer Archetiture: 
	Caching, cachelines.
	

Dynamic Programming:
	1) "careful brute force"
	2) guessing + recursion + memorization
	3) shortest path in some DAG
	time = #subproblems * time/subproblem
	

My own experience:


Questions for interviewer:
	1) What's your job in the company.
	2) How does each team collbrate with other.
